From the same dataset I focussed on "Feed" and "Instagram Stories". I had to calculate the Feed CPM of every week and of every day. So I created two new coloumns where I I calculated the Number of the week and the day of the week..
Then I grouped by per week and later per weekday and I calculate the total amount and total Amount/1000 that I needed it to calculate the CPM
